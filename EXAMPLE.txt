Text can be **bold**, /italic/ (also, *italic*), ~~striked~~. You can **/combine/** features.

Titles come in 3 sizes:

# Title 1
## Title 2
### Title 3

Lists are created with "•". This can be typed by pressing "-".
• Item 1
• Item 2 **bold** /italic/ still work here.
• Item 3

Code blocks are created with Tab. Each line has to be indented
	#include <stdio.h>
	
	int main(void) {
		printf("Hello!");
	
		return 0;
	}

Formatting doesn't work within codeblocks. You can escape special characters anytime using \*\*backspaces\*\*.

Images can be embedded with [ok.png]. Images display only if there is a newline. If multiple [ok.png] images are included, they are displayed side-by-side.
